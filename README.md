#Youtube Ad Blocker

This is just a test to undestand how to create chrome extensions

It is under construction, and the ideia is use the youtube ads css class to identify ads and close then.
I don think that this is the best approach for this, but it≈õ a way that youtube cannot detect that I am blocking and the main go here is learn about chrome extensions 

Notes:

It works fine, but is not performatic.

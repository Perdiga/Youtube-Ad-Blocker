#Youtube Ad Blocker

This is just a test to undestand how to create chrome extensions

It is under construction, and the ideia is use the youtube ads css class to identify ads and close then.
I don think that this is the best approach for this, but it≈õ a way that youtube cannot detect that I am blocking and the main go here is learn about chrome extensions 

For now if you click on the green button all ads will be skipped and you need to click on the green button every time that you open a youtube tab.
